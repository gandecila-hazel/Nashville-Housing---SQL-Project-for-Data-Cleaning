# **Nashville-Housing---SQL-Project-for-Data-Cleaning**
## This project embarks on a data cleaning journey through the realm of Nashville's housing data.

Imagine a vast dataset teeming with valuable information, yet riddled with inconsistencies, missing values, and wonky formats. Your mission, armed with your trusty SQL toolkit, is to transform this raw chaos into a polished gem ready for insightful analysis.

**The Data Detective:**
Unearthing inconsistencies: Identify and rectify inconsistencies in date formats, address spellings, and categorical values. Standardize formats and create cohesive representations.
Missing in action: Tackle missing values with strategic imputations, deletions, or even estimations based on other data points.
Outlier alert: Unmask outlying values that might skew analysis. Investigate their validity and decide on appropriate cleaning methods.
Splitting secrets: Extract valuable details hidden within combined columns. Break down addresses, owner information, and other fields for finer-grained analysis.
